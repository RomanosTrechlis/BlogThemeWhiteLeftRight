        </p>
        <p>My name is Romanos Trechlis, I'm a Software Engineer from Athens, Greece.</p>
        <p>I studied Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering at <a href="http://www.ece.upatras.gr/gr/" target="_blank">University of Patras</a>.</p>
        <p>Having an interest in history and geopolitics I studied Diplomacy and Geopolitics at the Greek branch of Centre dâ€™Etudes Diplomatiques et Strategiques.</p>
        <p>I work at <a href="https://procureship.com/" target="_blank">Procureship</a>, a greek startup specializing in providing an online market for marine buyers and suppliers of the shipping industry.</p>
        <p>I formerly worked at Piraeus Bank's IT Departement, implementing the retail loan origination system, built with Java over a BPM Engine. My main focus was in integration with external systems.</p>
        <p>Go, machine learning, and sword fighting keep me busy in my spare time.</p>
